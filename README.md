# weather-app
I built a  JavaScript weather app in SheCodes Plus, an 
advanced 8-week JavaScript coding workshop. Building upon my 
previously-gained knowledge, I also became skilled in Bootstrap, 
APIâ€™s, real-life development workflow, hosting, and advanced 
JavaScript. I combined all of these skills to create a fully-functioning 
weather app.
