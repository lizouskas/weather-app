# weather-app
I developed a comprehensive weather application using JavaScript during the SheCodes Plus program, an intensive 8-week workshop focused on advanced JavaScript coding. This experience not only honed my existing expertise but also equipped me with proficiency in Bootstrap, API integration, real-world development processes, hosting, and advanced JavaScript techniques. I seamlessly integrated all of these skills to produce a highly functional weather application.
